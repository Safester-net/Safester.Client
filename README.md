Safester.Client is the C# [Xamarin](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/xamarin/) project of [Safester](https://www.safester.net) Email encryption service. 

It contains all source code of both [Safester for Android](https://safester.net/install_android/) and [Safester for iOS](https://safester.net/install_ios/) Editions. 

(Safesterâ€™s source code for [macOS](https://safester.net/install_macos/),  [Linux](https://safester.net/install_linux/) and [Windows](https://safester.net/install_windows/), is being finalized and will be published very soon in Open Source on GitHub.)

## Cryptography & OpenPGP

Safester.Client text and file encryptions are made with the  [OpenPGP](https://www.openpgp.org/)  cryptography protocol. 

The underlying base OpenPGP crypto library used is [Bouncy Castle](http://www.bouncycastle.org/csharp/). 

The [OpenPGP](https://www.openpgp.org/) and cryptographic calls are all wrapped using the [Safester.Cryptolibrary](https://github.com/kawansoft/Safester.CryptoLibrary) intermediate C# library.
